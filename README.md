# A telegram bot weather reportor

This is a simple framework for telegram bot. It can help you to build a bot to send weather report automatically.

 - You can subscribe a weather report, and the bot will send you a report daily at specific time

 - After subscribing, the bot will check weather every 5 minutes, and send you alert if there is one.

 > The bot support multi-language, but I not yet complete this function and enrich the languages, it will be my pleasure if you can help.
